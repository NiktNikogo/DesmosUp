# DesmosUp

DesmosUp is a project about adding some cool functionality to Desmos based around OEIS and sequences.
You need vite to run this project, after that run
```
npm run dev
```
in your project directory

## Main features are:
- Ability to add a sequence from OEIS by giving their index
- Transforming sequences in various ways
- Performing actions on them, such as making a polynomial, with it's coefficients being entires in the sequence
- Making a cartesian product between to given sequences
- Ability to use js to code your own sequence
 
## Todo:
- Add a way to make more transformations and actions easier
- Make the whole page responsive
- Make more ways to combine two sequences
- Adding more fun functionality, i.e. ability to make shapes, turtle, some cool things from mathologer, numberphile or 3Blue1Brown videos

### Credits:
- Thanks for CodeMirror for their amazing syntax highlighting tool
- Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin allowing for making OEIS fetching work, till I figure out any other way
